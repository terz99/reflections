Dushan's Version Control Lesson 1 Reflections

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - I saw the changes made in the newer file and analyzed them deeper.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	- I could more easily debug and I could go deeper into the concepts of my program and not be afraid that I will jeopardize the entire project

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    - Pros: You can choose when to make a commit
    - Cons: You won't be able to track down more recent versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Google Docs doesnâ€™t have files that relate to each other like Git does. Google Docs are treated as a separate entity because a change in one does not affect a change in another

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    - When I run 'git log' I can see the history of commits and then by running 'git diff ID#1 ID#2' I can see the changes which happened between commits ID#1 and ID#2. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    - I will make me more confident because I can always recover previous versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    - Android or Web Development Projects.
